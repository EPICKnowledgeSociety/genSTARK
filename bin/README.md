# genSTARK
This library is intended to help you quickly and easily generate STARK-based proofs of computation using JavaScript. The goal is to take care of as much boilerplate code as possible, and let you focus on the specifics of the task at hand.

### Disclaimer
**DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY IN PRODUCTION.** At this point, this is a research-grade library. It has known and unknown bugs, and the performance is at least one order of magnitude below what could be considered acceptable.

# Install
```Bash
$ npm install @guildofweavers/genstark --save
```

# Usage
Here is a trivial example of how to use this library. In this case, the computation is just adding 1 to the current value at each step. That is: x<sub>n+1</sub> = x<sub>n</sub> + 1.

```TypeScript
import { Stark, PrimeField, ExecutionFrame, EvaluationFrame } from '@guildofweavers/genstark';

// define a very simple state transition function 
function fooTransition(this: ExecutionFrame) {
    const v = this.getValue(0);     // get value for current step from register 0
    const nv = this.add(v, 1n);
    this.setNextValue(0, nv);       // next state = current state + 1
} 

// define a corresponding transition constraint
function fooConstraint(this: EvaluationFrame): bigint {
    const v = this.getValue(0);             // get value for current step from register 0
    const nv = this.getNextValue(0);        // get value for the next step from register 0
    return this.sub(nv, this.add(v, 1n));   // return nv - (v + 1)
}

// build a STARK for this computation
const fooStark = new Stark({
    field               : new PrimeField(2n**32n - 3n * 2n**25n + 1n),
    registerCount       : 1,                // we only need 1 register
    tFunction           : fooTransition,
    tConstraints        : [fooConstraint],
    tConstraintDegree   : 1                 // degree of our constraint is 1
});

// create a proof that if we start computation at 1, we end up at 64 after 64 steps
const assertions = [
    { register: 0, step: 0, value: 1n },    // value at first step is 1
    { register: 0, step: 63, value: 64n }   // value at last step is 64
];
const proof = fooStark.prove(assertions, 64, [1n]);

// verify that if we start at 1 and run the computation for 64 steps, we get 64
const result = fooStark.verify(assertions, proof, 64);
console.log(result); // true
```

There are a few more sophisticated examples in this repository:
* [MiMC STARK](/examples/mimc.ts) - basically the same as Vitalik Buterin's [MiMC tutorial](https://vitalik.ca/general/2018/07/21/starks_part_3.html).
* [Fibonacci STARK](/examples/fibonacci.ts) - proofs of computation for [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
* [Demo STARK](/examples/demo.ts) - demonstration of how to use readonly registers.

When you run the examples, you should get a nice log documenting each step. Here is an example output of running MiMC STARK for 2<sup>13</sup> steps:
