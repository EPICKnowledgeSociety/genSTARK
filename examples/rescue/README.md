# Rescue STARKs

Examples in this directory can be used to prove knowledge of a preimage for modified version of [Rescue hash function](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/426.pdf). As compared to the original construct, the modifications are as follows:

* The second step of the last round is omitted from the computation;
* The first step of the first round is pre-computed;
* The function is restricted to accepting a single value..

 All constants used in computations were generated by using code from here: https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/Marvellous.

## Concrete examples

### Hash 2x64

In this example, the following parameters are uses:
 * p (field modulus): 2^64 - 21 * 2^30 + 1
 * m (number of registers): 2
 * N (rounds): 32

 ### Hash 4x128

In this example, the following parameters are uses:
 * p (field modulus): 2^128 - 9 * 2^32 + 1
 * m (number of registers): 4
 * N (rounds): 32
